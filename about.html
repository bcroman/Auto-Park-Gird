            <p class="lead">This website is gamified learning tool which is designed to help beginners developers and
                learn and understand CSS Grid through interactive, puzzle based challenges. Instead of memorising
                concepts, users learn by writing real CSS and seeing the update visually.</p>

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>Each level introduces a specific CSS Grid concept such as rows, columns, and spanning.</p>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Read the learning content and challenge details.</li>
                <li>Write CSS into the editor to control the grid layout.</li>
                <li>Check your solution against the challenge target.</li>
                <li>Receive feedback and hints if needed.</li>
                <li>Progress to the next level and learn a new concept.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Solutions are validated by checking the final layout output, rather than matching text base. This means
                there are multiple correct solutions can be accepted, as long the resulting render matches the
                level goal.</p>
